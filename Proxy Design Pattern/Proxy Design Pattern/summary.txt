Here is a real-world implementation of the Proxy design pattern in C#. In this example, you will see how the proxy design pattern hides the actual object. The example shows a logging proxy. It logs the operation before RealSubject performs the math operation.


output

Calling the Math functions via Proxy
Log addition
20 + 2 = 22
Log substraction
20 - 2 = 18
Log multiplication
20 x 2 = 40
Log division
20 / 2 = 10
